# AddressBooker
Address book application made with Python, using TKinter for the GUI and MySQLite to hold the database.

Run 'python main.py' to run the application. 
The included database is a mixture of randomly generated data and is not real. It is perfect to play around with though.

This project was built for my Software Methodology course, with a team of five in under 3 weeks. 
We used the iterative process to reach each of our 3 milestones. 

Go ahead! Play with it.
